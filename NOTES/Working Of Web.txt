Basic 5 terminology in Web :

Protocols : Set of Rules to communicate b/w two applications (client and server)

Client --(request)--> Server --(request)--> Database 
Database --(response)--> Server --(response)--> Client 

Every requests respond through API (Eg: Hotel Waiter)

Web - https(SECURED(LOCKED)),http

IP Address : Internet Protocol, Unique 

FORMAT => (0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255) 
Example : 198.180.1.1

To get ip address of the site - ping http//google.com


Two types of IP Address:
1) Public IP --> important
2) Private IP

Website can be accessed by IP address but it's hard to memorise so we are accessing it using the domain name (Eg: google.com)
Domain Registars will provide domain name

DNS MAPPING : 
Public Ip         Domain name
142.250.182.68     Wiki.com

We can acess server by using public IP address but users cannot memorise ip address to access the website so we have to use Domain then DNS process has to done manually


Working of Website : 
Client ---(Domain name)---->DNS  // Client req server DNS will return IP address to the client after that only request sent to server
DNS ---(IP Address)----> Client
Client ---(Request)--->Server
So, Public IP is very important 
        URL
Uniform Resource locator => https://www.google.com/ hello.html
                            |          |            |
                        Protocol  DomainNameOf(IP)  Path (A page in webpage)

When path is empty server will return index.html as default

Domain name - www.swiggy.com
                    |     |
                   Name Top Level Domain(TLD)
sub domain = oru domain purchase panirkomnaa name ku munadi evlo words venalum potuklaam (eg: auth.swiggy.com)
Same IP addrress can be mapped with many subdomains
